# Debidy

**Debidy** is a program that makes sending any files without a size limit on discord.
I created this to work more easily with a friend on a game.
How the app works is explained in this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXQxjy9HJ9A).

Basically, its cuts the files in several parts then it sends every part one by one.

## Notes
Debidy probably doesn't work anymore because it fetched github files that i deleted to check new updates, so the app may crash.
